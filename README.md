# Mental Math
A web-based mental math game that trains you in doing math using only your head and nothing more.
<br><br>
It offers an endless mode, where you end the questions only when you want, and a predefined-questions mode, where you assign a specific number of questions you want to solve.

## Tech used
Only HTML5, CSS3 and Javascript, meaning it can be cloned and easily run in any machine/browser.
<br><br>
I did not use any framework for Javascript, as it was an exercise on my knowledge of pure js and html/css.
